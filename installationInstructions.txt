Getting setup for using LaTeX

Note: The Detailed Version
To download MikTeX go to

http://miktex.org/2.8/setup

at the bottom of the page Download the MikTeX 2.8 Net Installer (2.94 Meg).

When you run the installer it will ask you for a Directory into which to download all the MikTeX setup Files (So create a folder on your Desktop Something like "MikTeXInstallationFiles").


You will also need to select from which site you wish to download the files from, choose a UK based host.
It will then download > 500 meg worth of files.

Once the download is complete, you will have to run the installer again, and direct it to the "MikTeXInstallationFiles" Folder, it will then install those files into your C:\ drive.

Next download and install GhostScript (V9.00 released 2010-09-17).

Then download and install GhostView (V4.9) (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/get49.htm)
http://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/ghostgum/gsv49w32.exe (32 Bit edition, 64 Bit also available)

Finally download and install an Editor (WinShell)
http://www.winshell.org/WinShell331.exe

You should now have a fully functioning LaTeX system up and running.
If you take a look at the MikTeX installation on your C drive, you will see that it consists of well over 40K in files, and occupies just a few gigs.

Note: The Simple Version
A simpler way of achieving an complete install is to download a self-extracting executable file.
This is approx 950Megs in size, and provides you with the latest MikTeX Distribution, Ghostscript, Ghostview, and an editor called TeXnicCenter.
Available from http://www.tug.org/protext/
You can always install WinShell editor later on once the LaTeX system itself is up and running.

Aside: PDF Conversion

You may also find it useful to install a PDF printer (The lab machines should have PDF Converter), all you have to do is go to File > Print and choose the PDF printer to generate a pdf of the document you are printing.

First download and install the print driver

Then the actual converter
